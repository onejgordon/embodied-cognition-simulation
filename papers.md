# Empirical Evidence (Embodied Cognition, Simulation Theory)

## Visual Perception

* Eye scanpaths during visual imagery reenact those of perception of the same visual scene ([Laeng and Teodorescu, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0364021301000659))
* In hippocampal amnesia patients have trouble imaginining future events -- processing memories may be precondition for self-projection (Hassabis, Kumaran, Vann, and Maguire, 2007)
* Attention moves like eye movement ([Posner, 2007](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00335558008248231))
* Mental rotation of shapes goes with angle of rotation (Shepard & Metzler, 1971)
* Perceptions as hypotheses: saccades as experiments ([Friston et al, 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00151/full))

## Action Perception & Simulation 

* Ability to recognize static image as continuation of occluded video higher when frame consistent with action. Also interference after priming via action words (Graf et al, 2007)
* Patient with bilateral lesions unable to refrain from executing imagined hand movements (Schwoebel, Boronat, and Coslett, 2002)
* Subjects who imagined leg exercise showed increased heart rate and respiration proportional to imagined effort (Decety et al, 1991)
* Proactivity of gaze behavior (predictions) impaired when participants observed othersâ€™ actions with their hands tied ([Ambrosini, E., Sinigaglia, C., & Costantini, M., 2012](http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2011-30112-001))
* Activity in visual cortex and somatosensory cortex correlated with imagined light flashes and arm touch respectively (Davidson and Schwartz, 1977)

## Social & Empathy

* Monkeys prefer to interact with individuals who imitate their behavior (Paukner, Suomi, Visalberghi, & Ferrari, 2009)
* Frontal brain regions are more strongly activated when a person has to anticipate the action of another individual with whom there are previous interactions (Kourtis, Sebanz, & Knoblich, 2010)
* Somatomotor resonance when subjects observe a painful stimulation delivered to the hand of a model dependent on subject's ability to adopt the model's perspective (also racial in-group out-group) (Avenanti, Minio-Paluello, Bufalari, & Aglioti, 2009)
* Reduced action simulation during the observation of communicative gestures from out-group members (Molnar-Szakacs et al., 2007)
* Increased heart rate after exercise facilitates the processing of fearful but not disgusted faces	([G Pezzulo, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18761-5.pdf))
* In observation of object-related manual actions (block-stacking), the coordination between gaze and the actor's hand is very similar to gaze-hand coordination during own performance (Flanagan and Johansson, 2003)
